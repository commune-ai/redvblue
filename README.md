## VERSION 0.1

## What the fuck is this?

This is a game where a red teamer needs to jailbreak a model that is scored between 0 and 1, where 1 is maximally inappropriate. The score is defined by our Jailbreak Score Function (NOT TRADEMARKED). 

Lineage of Game
 
0. Signin: User Signs in with Secret (not stored on server)
1. Redteam Attack: User Sends a message to the Model of Choice
2. Jailbreak Score Model: Jail Break Score from Jailbreak Score Model
3. Response Saved on Server side for Jailbreak Leaderboards.

## The Jailbreak Score Function

The Jailbreak Score Function is a function that takes in the model's response and returns a score. The score is a float between 0 and 1. The score is 0 if the response is appropriate and 1 if the response is inappropriate. The threshold can be adjusted to make the scoring more or less strict. At the moment, we assume that the threshold is 0.5.


## Flexible and Upgradable Function

This model is very flexible and can allow for any method that can score a response between 0 and 1. This means we can upgrade the function to a flexible functions


## Leaderboards

The leaderboard calculates a list of the top models and their scores. The leaderboard is updated every time a new model is scored. The leaderboard is sorted by the score in ascending order.
